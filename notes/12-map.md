☑ Experiment with ObservableHQ graphs ⇒ https://observablehq.com/@artemgr/rusty-gun-a-story  
☐ Learn from https://observablehq.com/@d3/mobile-patent-suits  
☐ See if https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTBp0Lmw4ZE helps  
☐ Make a larger map in `rusty-gun-a-story`  
☐ Gource in the README  
→ ☐ Upload the Gource log also, making it accessible from ObservableHQ, in case we'd want to add dynamic JS visualizations later  
☐ Consider making a list of projects using the rusty GUN. Should it be in the README? Can we feature a random project/contributor/backer in the README (similar to crate-of-the-week in TWiR)? cf. https://github.com/GiraffeKey/dahlia

☐ Experiment with Qualitative Interviewing  
→ ☑ Create a separate MarkDown space  
→ ☐ Finish working through the book  
→ ☐ Grab the book highlights  
→ ☐ Revisit the book highlights  
☐ Consider creating a Telegram channel in order to allow for convenient video messaging  
→ ☐ See if Telescope is supported in Telegram groups  
→ ☑ Telescope promotes good video ecology: short videos are easier to discard and retry, easier to watch and to index, allow for chunked communication and dialogue. Question is, can we transfer this somehow to Discord? A bot that would copy the Telegram Telescope videos to Discord? And should we bother? ⇒ Discord can embed short (under 8 MB) libx264 mp4 videos, which seems good enough, though maybe we should collect the ways to record these  
☐ Figure how/if the Qualitative Interviewing can factor into the bounty-driven development  
→ ☐ Consider the format of public podcasts  
→ ☑ Experiment with video attachments on GitHub  
→ ☐ Play with the idea of (incentivized) transcripts
