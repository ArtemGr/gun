☑ Experiment with ObservableHQ graphs ⇒ https://observablehq.com/@artemgr/rusty-gun-a-story  
☐ Learn from https://observablehq.com/@d3/mobile-patent-suits  
☐ See if https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTBp0Lmw4ZE helps  
☐ Make a larger map in `rusty-gun-a-story`  
☐ Gource in the README  
☐ Consider making a list of projects using the rusty GUN. Should it be in the README? Can we feature a random project/contributor/backer in the README (similar to crate-of-the-week in TWiR)? cf. https://github.com/GiraffeKey/dahlia
