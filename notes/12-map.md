☑ Experiment with ObservableHQ graphs ⇒ https://observablehq.com/@artemgr/rusty-gun-a-story  
☐ Learn from https://observablehq.com/@d3/mobile-patent-suits  
☐ See if https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTBp0Lmw4ZE helps  
☐ Make a larger map in `rusty-gun-a-story`  
→ ☑ Narrow down to major goals ⇒ Bottom-up development; modularity; transfer of knowledge in OSS  
☐ Gource in the README  
cf. https://superuser.com/questions/556029/how-do-i-convert-a-video-to-gif-using-ffmpeg-with-reasonable-quality  
cf. https://github.com/cyburgee/ffmpeg-guide  
→ ☐ Upload the Gource log also, making it accessible from ObservableHQ, in case we'd want to add dynamic JS visualizations later  
☐ Consider making a list of projects using the rusty GUN. Should it be in the README? Can we feature a random project/contributor/backer in the README (similar to crate-of-the-week in TWiR)? cf. https://github.com/GiraffeKey/dahlia  
☐ List contributors in Change Log, cf. https://github.com/Geal/nom/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md

☐ Experiment with bottom-up (leader-leader) bounty-driven development  
→ ☐ Phase one, the Telegram group  

☐ Consider the competition format,  
cf. https://vk.com/durovschallenge, https://t.me/contests_ru, https://t.me/contest, https://codeforces.com/

☐ Explore some of the literature adjucent to motivation streams

→ ☐ Brain Tingles  
→ ☐ What the F  
→ ☐ Man's search for meaning  
→ ☐ Louder Than Words

☐ Experiment with Qualitative Interviewing  
→ ☑ Create a separate MarkDown space  
→ ☑ Transcript the first set of interviews  
→ ☐ Second round, self-wishing and the Happy New Year  
→ ☐ Finish working through the book  
→ ☐ Grab the book highlights  
→ ☐ Revisit the book highlights  
→ ☑ Assemble a list of people whom we can ask about GUN  
☐ Consider creating a Telegram channel in order to allow for convenient video messaging  
→ ☐ See if Telescope is supported in Telegram groups  
→ ☑ Telescope promotes good video ecology: short videos are easier to discard and retry, easier to watch and to index, allow for chunked communication and dialogue. Question is, can we transfer this somehow to Discord? A bot that would copy the Telegram Telescope videos to Discord? And should we bother? ⇒ Discord can embed short (under 8 MB) libx264 mp4 videos, which seems good enough, though maybe we should collect the ways to record these  
☐ Figure how/if the Qualitative Interviewing can factor into the bounty-driven development  
→ ☑ File the idea of embedded QI  
→ ☑ Consider the format of public podcasts ⇒ Known downsides: time synchronization, TMI, hard to get different opinions from different people, postprocessing not included  
→ ☑ Experiment with video attachments on GitHub  
→ ☐ Play with the idea of (incentivized) transcripts

☐ Look at gossipsub, as it might affect the design and the wishlists around the p2p layers

# work group

@mhelander on SEA: “my part was to make SEA to work, how it's integrated into Gun is more @marknadal super skills I think...”, continued at https://discord.com/channels/612645357850984470/612645357850984473/793023656795045920

@mimiza: “I only implemented SEA.certify(). It's just a small part in SEA. I don't even know SEA better than @mhelander”

Mark: “@mhelander @jabis @mmalmi @rogowski @mimiza @go1dfish @Dletta probably have the best understanding of various internal parts”
